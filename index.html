    <p><i> Interesting Facts about Origami </i> 
        Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori 
        (folded) and Kami (paper).Before that, the art
         was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient 
         Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand 
         cranes you will be granted a wish.

<p> <i> Interesting Facts about Origami</i>
    Many studies assert that origami was invented
     by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, 
     but its roots may well be in China.
     It is also highly probable that the 
     process of folding was applied to other
      materials before paper was invented, 
      so the origins of recreational folding 
      may lie with cloth or leather.</p>
